## Documentation

Simple to make AWS calls. Settup is easy too!

###### **AWS Setup**
 * AWS doesn't lay out the Credentials setup for you set by step, so I will.
    1. Open Terminal
    2. If you haven't created your credentials yet, in Terminal's fresh page, type in:
        '''
            - nano ~/.aws/creds
        '''
